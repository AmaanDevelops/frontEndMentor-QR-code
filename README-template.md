### Built with

### What I learned

In this project i learned about css custom properties and box-shadow and about viewport units.

```css
:root {
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}

.card {
    box-shadow: 0px 7px 45px -35px;
}
```
