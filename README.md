### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this project, I learned about CSS custom properties, box-shadow, and viewport units.

```css
:root {
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}

.card {
    box-shadow: 0px 7px 45px -35px;
}
```

### Useful resources

-(https://youtu.be/NtRmIp4eMjs) - Fireship.io's video on CSS custom properties was perfect for explaining the topic. Jeff Delaney's channel is exceptionally helpful.
